Project Overview
The GENX  project is a simple, user-friendly solution that enhances navigation on any webpage with multiple sections.
 The core idea is to make it easier for users to know exactly where they are on the page and allow them to jump smoothly between sections with a click.
 This project is perfect for websites with multiple sections or landing pages, and its built purely with vanilla JavaScript, meaning no external libraries or dependencies are needed. 
 It,s designed to be easy to implement, lightweight, and simple to customize.

Dynamic Menu: The navigation items are created automatically based on the content of the page. No need to hard-code links.
Smooth Scrolling: Clicking on a link will smoothly scroll the page to the corresponding section, offering a great user experience.
Active Section Highlighting: The section currently in view is automatically highlighted in the menu, so you always know where you are.
